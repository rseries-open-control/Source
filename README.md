This is a kind of legacy project at this point, having been supplanted by other open source R2 ocontrol projects.  In some ways, this one was a bit over-ambitious, and too complex for many users.  Still, it was one of the earlier efforts at a cohesive control method for droids, and has in many ways informed later efforts.  The hardware, designs, and code is preserved here for reference, and perhaps to be forked for new things later.

Much of this stuff is incomplete, or experimental.  Nonetheless, it is also pretty useful as-is, or a base to build upon.  It's a hobby project, I hope nobody expected a warranty!
